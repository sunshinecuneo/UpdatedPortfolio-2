            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <img src="assets/images/TC.jpg" height=220 width=175 class="myImage">

            <p>I am a single mom to a wonderfully precocious, very happy nine year
                old beauty whose name is Grace! We have a smiley dog named Mavis and
                three chickens; Murdoch, April and Little Peepers. I live in Denver in
                the house I grew up in. I am a fiercely indepedant introvert who loves
                most to be at home enjoying time with my daughter and our little urban
                farm family. I enjoy sleeping, watching tv, gardening and cooking and
                baking, especially for others. I can fix or construct just about anything.
                I have a very strong intuition that I trust completely. </p>
            <p>I have a strong work ethic; often going above and beyond in all I do. I
                was taught that if I'm going to do a job I better do it right so I strive
                for accuracy. I am dedicated and reliable and I can efficiently multitask.
                I have great research skills and think of myself as highly resourceful. I
                can work collaboratively as part of a team or individually with minimal
                supervision. </p>
